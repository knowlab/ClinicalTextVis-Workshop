# ClinicalTextVis-Workshop - Clinical Text Visualisation Workshop

Let's visualise and celebrate!

There are three basic ideas:
* visualise texts
* visualise models
* visualise outcomes or analyses of the data

The data were from [MedCAT](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT), based on synthetic clinical notes in [mtsamples](https://www.mtsamples.com/).

All clinical notes are in [`noteevents.csv`](https://github.com/knowlab/ClinicalTextVis-Workshop/blob/main/noteevents.csv) and all patients' information are in [`patients.csv`](https://github.com/knowlab/ClinicalTextVis-Workshop/blob/main/patients.csv).

Some quick [preprocessing codes](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nQ3H7plYoOyC6MzqxECbm02oxoY6F3ZL#scrollTo=D1mjVdNzcx3L) from MedCAT.

To do:
* add SemEHR annotations
* add basic preprocessing functions - let me know what you want!
    * function 1
    * function 2
    * function 3
